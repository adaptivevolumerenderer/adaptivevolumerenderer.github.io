          In this project, we explore a more efficient way of volume rendering given a neural scene representation. 
          In specific, given a locally conditioned Neural Radiance Field introduced in PixelNeRF, we replace 
          the evenly sampled points in their volume rendering procedure with adaptively sampled points to reduce
          the time cost associated with the procedure. We obtain adaptively sampled points by first predict the approximate 
          intersection between the query ray and the scene via the differentiable ray-marching technique using LSTM, and 
          then evenly sample points with tiny steps.

            Our work is inspired by recent work in the field that focuses on predicting neural scene representation with one or few input images. 
            We review the related work behind the key techniques in our project.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Local Conditioning on Neural Radiance Fields</strong> PixelNeRF \cite{yu2021pixelnerf} augments Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) 
            \cite{mildenhall2021nerf}, a 3D scene representation algorithm based on neural network, by including a fully convolutional 
            image encoder to learn spatial image features that can be shared across scenes, as well as the local-conditioning technique 
            that extract the local features by projecting the query points onto input images. 
            Another line of work \cite{henzler2021unsupervised,reizenstein2021common} introduced similar techniques with different way 
            of aggregating local features, and they refer this kind of technique as Wrap-Conditioned Embedding (WCE). 
            Reizenstein et al.\cite{reizenstein2021common} also incorporates WCE into Scene Representation Network (SRN)\cite{sitzmann2019scene}, 
            which showed a decent improvement in performance than the vanilla SRN and actually resulted in the best depth 
            estimation results in their experiments.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Aggregating projected features with Transformer</strong> When we apply WCE to multi-view inputs, we need to 
            aggregate local features extracted from multiple query points on multiple views. PixelNeRF simply process each 
            query point independently, and aggregate by averaging over multiple views. NerFormer instead uses a Transformer 
            to process these features and produced better results. They argued that a Transformer (1) can learn to aggregate 
            features from multiple views in a smart way and (2) is capable of spatial reasoning on multiple query points.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Differentiable Ray Marching</strong> Both PixelNeRF\cite{yu2021pixelnerf} and NerFormer\cite{reizenstein2021common} 
            use volume rendering with evenly spaced points along the query ray, which might contain many points in empty spaces. 
            Since volume rendering is a slow explicit rendering technique, this could result in wasteful computational resources. 
            On the other hand, SRN\cite{sitzmann2019scene} uses a differentiable ray marching technique, which employs an LSTM to adaptively 
            sample points along the query ray until it finds the intersection of the query ray with the scene. SRN then pass 
            this intersection point through a pixel generator network that directly yields the color, instead of using volume rendering. 
            Reizenstein et al.\cite{reizenstein2021common} shows that NerFormer performs better than SRN+WCE in many categories, 
            possibly suggesting that volume rendering, although more expensive, produces better results than neural rendering.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          
          <p>
            We propose an adapted version of differentiable ray marching algorithm that will first use ray marching long short-term memory (RM-LSTM) 
            along the query ray to learn the adaptive step-length for the tracing algorithm. The goal of the RM-LSTM algorithm is to land in a 
            neighborhood to the actual surface of the scene in order for the neural radiance field to learn the output. As an extension, we can 
            sample points starting from that approximate intersection point predicted by the RM-LSTM algorithm with much smaller step sizes and 
            perform volume rendering along those points. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We did our experiment by modifying the current structure of PixelNeRF. Instead of a standard volume rendering procedure, we extract the
            latent features learned by the CNN encoder of PixelNeF and then feed the features as input into the RM-LSTM algorithm in the picture below.
            Essentially, the RM-LSTM predicts the steplength on the ray of interest and update the depth. The RM-LSTM is set to have the number of feature 
            channels being 512.We set the number of steps to be 30 in our experiments due to computational constraints. Once the depth is predicted, 
            we add a regularization process which penalizes any unreasonable predicted depth, which we the range of reasonable depths to be between xx and xx. 
            We then pass the output through the PixelNeRF process again to obtain rgb values with the neural network within PixelNeRF. In our experiments,
            we use pretrained ResNet 34 model for the CNN encoder.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For our extension, we did the same procedure as before up to the point where we do the regularization process. After the regularization, instead
            of running through PixelNeRF again, we sample n = 16 points around +/-0.1 neighborhood of predicted depth and use standard volume rendering process to
            calculate the final rgb value.
